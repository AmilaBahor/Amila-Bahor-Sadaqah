	<p>For those who give in Charity, men and women, and loan to Allah a Beautiful Loan, it shall be increased manifold (to their credit), and they shall have (besides) a liberal reward. <br>The Holy Qur’an 57:18 <br>
	Sadaqah, meaning ‘charity’, is the concept of voluntary giving in Islam, fi sabillilah (for the cause of Allah). The term stems from the Arabic root word ‘sidq’, which means sincerity. So giving Sadaqah is considered a sign of sincere faith.</p>
